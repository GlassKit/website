# User Interface

This section goes over the major UI components of Glass, when they are useful, and how users interact with them.

## The timeline controls most of the user experience
The timeline is the main user interface that is exposed to users and is comprised of 640 Ã— 360 pixel cards. It provides many features such as a standard way to present live and static cards, system-wide voice commands, and a common way to launch Glassware.

Users scroll through different sections of the timeline to reveal cards in the past, present, and future. The most recent items reside closest to the Home card, which is the default card users see when they wake Glass up.
